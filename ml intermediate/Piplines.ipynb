    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "- **Cleaner Code**: Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy. With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n",
    "- **Fewer Bugs**: There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n",
    "- **Easier to Productionize**: It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "- **More Options for Model Validation**: You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation."
